Smart Water Leak Detection
Project Overview: 

This project uses AI and Deep Learning to detect potential water bursts using real-time sensor data. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and model training to build a predictive system.

📁 Workflow
✅ 1. Data Cleaning

Removed null values and encoded categorical columns
Converted datatypes for ML compatibility
🔗 2. Data Merging

Combined relevant datasets using Sensor_ID
Ensured a consistent format for modeling
📊 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers
Used heatmaps, histograms, and line plots
🤖 4. Machine Learning Models

Applied classification algorithms like Random Forest, SVM
Evaluated using accuracy and F1-score
🧠 5. Deep Learning Model

Built a Sequential Neural Network with Keras
Used Dense layers for binary classification (Burst Status)
📈 6. Final Output: Line Chart

Plotted training vs. validation loss to assess model performance
🧪 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook
Dataset: Kaggle Water Leak Dataset
