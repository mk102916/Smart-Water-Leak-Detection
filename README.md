Smart Water Leak Detection
Project Overview: 

This project uses AI and Deep Learning to detect potential water bursts using real-time sensor data. It involves data cleaning, visualization, and model training to build a predictive system.

Workflow
1. Data Cleaning

Removed null values and encoded categorical columns
Converted datatypes for ML compatibility

2. Data Merging

Combined relevant datasets using Sensor_ID
Ensured a consistent format for modeling

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers
Used heatmaps, histograms, and line plots

4. Machine Learning Models

Applied classification algorithms like Random Forest, SVM
Evaluated using accuracy and F1-score

5. Deep Learning Model

Built a Sequential Neural Network with Keras
Used Dense layers for binary classification (Burst Status)

6. Final Output: Line Chart

Plotted training vs. validation loss to assess model performance

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook
Dataset: Kaggle Water Leak Dataset
